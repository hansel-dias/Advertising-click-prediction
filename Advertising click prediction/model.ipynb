    "* Daily Time Spent on Site: Consumer's time on the site in minutes.\n",
    "* Age: Age of the consumer in years.\n",
    "* Area Income: Average income of the geographical area of the consumer.\n",
    "* Daily Internet Usage: Average minutes per day the consumer is on the internet.\n",
    "* Ad Topic Line: Headline of the advertisement.\n",
    "* City: City of the consumer.\n",
    "* Male: Binary indicator of whether the consumer is male (1 for male, 0 for female).\n",
    "* Country: Country of the consumer.\n",
    "* Timestamp: Time at which the consumer clicked on the ad or closed the window.\n",

    "## Project Tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Analysis and Preprocessing: Explore and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Gain insights into the relationships between different features, identify patterns, and understand the distribution of the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features and create new ones that might enhance the predictive performance of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Development: Build a machine learning model to predict whether a user will click on an ad. Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics and fine-tune if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deployment: Deploy the trained model, making it accessible for predictions in a real-world scenario. Choose an appropriate deployment platform and ensure that it integrates seamlessly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Monitoring and Maintenance: Implement monitoring mechanisms to keep track of the model's performance over time. Regularly update the model as needed to maintain its effectiveness."
