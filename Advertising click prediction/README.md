# Fake Advertising Data Analysis and Deployment Project

## Problem Statement

In this comprehensive project, our primary objective is to conduct an in-depth analysis of a fake advertising dataset. The dataset provides information about internet users and includes features such as daily time spent on the site, age, area income, daily internet usage, ad topic line, city, gender, country, and timestamp of ad interactions. The key task is to create a predictive model that can accurately determine whether a given user is likely to click on an advertisement based on these features.

### Dataset Features:

1. **Daily Time Spent on Site**: Consumer's time on the site in minutes.
2. **Age**: Age of the consumer in years.
3. **Area Income**: Average income of the geographical area of the consumer.
4. **Daily Internet Usage**: Average minutes per day the consumer is on the internet.
5. **Ad Topic Line**: Headline of the advertisement.
6. **City**: City of the consumer.
7. **Male**: Binary indicator of whether the consumer is male (1 for male, 0 for female).
8. **Country**: Country of the consumer.
9. **Timestamp**: Time at which the consumer clicked on the ad or closed the window.
10. **Clicked on Ad**: Binary label (0 or 1) indicating whether the consumer clicked on the advertisement.

## Project Tasks:

1. **Data Analysis and Preprocessing**: Explore and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Gain insights into the relationships between different features, identify patterns, and understand the distribution of the target variable.

3. **Feature Engineering**: Extract relevant features and create new ones that might enhance the predictive performance of the model.

4. **Model Development**: Build a machine learning model to predict whether a user will click on an ad. Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics and fine-tune if necessary.

5. **Deployment**: Deploy the trained model, making it accessible for predictions in a real-world scenario. Choose an appropriate deployment platform and ensure that it integrates seamlessly.

6. **Monitoring and Maintenance**: Implement monitoring mechanisms to keep track of the model's performance over time. Regularly update the model as needed to maintain its effectiveness.

Throughout the project, we aim to not only create an accurate predictive model but also provide a pathway for deploying this model in a practical setting, ensuring its continuous effectiveness in predicting ad clicks based on user behavior.
